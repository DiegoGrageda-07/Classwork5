# Classwork5 – Birthday Email Project

## 🎉 Overview
This project simulates a **birthday email** using HTML and CSS.  
It includes:
- A festive header and footer
- Three animated GIF “gifts”
- Two embedded videos:
  - An autoplay looping celebration clip
  - A control‑play personal message clip
- Fallback images for both videos to ensure compatibility with email clients

## 📂 Files
- `index.html` → Main HTML file with semantic structure
- `styles.css` → External stylesheet for layout, responsiveness, and accessibility
- `A_sparkling_birthday_present_with_ribbon.gif` → Gift image
- `Animated_balloons_floating_in_the_sky.gif` → Gift image
- `Cute_puppy_popping_out_of_a_gift_box.gif` → Gift image
- `birthday-celebration.mp4` → Autoplay video
- `video2.mp4` → Control‑play video
- `birthday_preview.jpg` → Fallback image for autoplay video
- `preview_of_vid_recording.jpg` → Fallback image for control‑play video

## 🚀 How to Open
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Safari).  
3. Ensure all media files (GIFs, MP4s, JPGs) are in the same folder or referenced correctly.

## ⚠️ Notes on Email Clients
- Many email clients (like Gmail or Outlook) **do not support embedded video**.  
- That’s why fallback images are included — so recipients see a preview instead of a broken video.  
- GIFs are widely supported, but autoplay video may not work in email environments.

## ✅ Accessibility Features
- Semantic HTML structure (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`)  
- Alt text for all images and aria labels for videos  
- Keyboard focus outlines for interactive elements  
- Responsive design for mobile devices
